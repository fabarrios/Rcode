# LDS LSADATA, chap 8 Daniel ANOVA
#
# Refer to the serum lipid-bound sialic acid data on 1400 subjects (LSADATA). We wish to conduct a study to determine 
# if the measurement of serum lipid-bound sialic acid (LSA) might be of use in the detection of breast cancer. The LSA 
# measurements (mg/dl) are for four populations of subjects: normal controls, A; patients with benign breast disease, 
# B; patients with primary breast cancer, C; and patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer, D. Select a simple 
# random sample of size 10 from each population and perform an appropriate analysis to determine if we may conclude that 
# the four population means are different. 
# Let α = .05 and determine the p value. 
# Test all possible pairs of sample means for significance. What conclusions can one draw from the analysis?

# Now change the column names accordint to the LDS descriptiom: Subject#:Col1, Controls:Col2
# patients with benign breast disease (BBD):Col3, patients with primary breast cancer (PBC):Col4
# patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer (RMBC)
LSAdata <- LSAdata %>% 
  rename(Subj = Col1, Cont = Col2, BBD = Col3, PBC = Col4, RMBC = Col5)
LSAdata_n <- LSAdata %>%

# Make LSAdata long
LSAdata_long <- LSAdata_n %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Type", values_to = "LSA")

# Make the Type of cancer variable a factor and then re-level to group and compare to Cont
LSAdata_long <- LSAdata_long %>% mutate( Type = factor(Type) )
LSAdata_long <- LSAdata_long %>% mutate( Type = Type %>% fct_relevel("Cont","BBD","PBC","RMBC") )

# does it look right? the following boxplot will tell
# boxplot(LSA ~ Type, data = LSAdata_long)
# nicer
LSAdata_long %>% ggplot(aes(x = Type, y = LSA)) +

# One Way ANOVA
# running a lm model for the ANOVA
LSAdata_lm <- lm(LSA ~ Type, data = LSAdata_long)
Anova(LSAdata_lm)

# and now the emmeans to look for estimating the Tukey and 95% confidence intervals
# first the pairwise comparisons with the Control group and contrasts
# then cancer condition compared to control
emmeans(LSAdata_lm, pairwise ~ Type)
emmeans(LSAdata_lm, trt.vs.ctrl ~ Type)


# Now a really nice solution with vilolin plots and corrected comparisons
# Thanks to the reslly nice library ggstatsplot
